# The Kingfisher Programming Language
Kingfisher is a programming language designed with built-in syntax for an entity component system with modern features, inspired by F#, Swift, and Haxe. The specification file details the syntax of the language, and the grammar file has the specific grammar used to parse the language.

## Current State
Currently, only a subset of the language is functional. This includes bindings, basic control flow, and a standard library of one function, println. As the parser is improved, the capabilities of the language will expand to its written standard.

## Sample code
```
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

for e in arr do
    if e % 2 = 0 then println e 
    else println 'Odd number'


fun add a b = a + b
add 3 4

when x is
    1, 2 -> ()
    1..5 -> ()
    (_, 'a') -> ()
    { _, field } -> ()
    [_, 1, 2] -> ()
    Color.Red -> ()
    Some num where num = 5 -> ()
    _ -> ()

// ECS 

// Entities
ent player = Transform PlayerController
ent 10 = Transform Collider

// Components
com Transform =  
    position: Vec3
    rotation: Vec3
    scale: Vec3
Transform@player

// System
sys Transform Enemy | Update =
    if keyPressed Key.Left then Transform.position.x <-+ 1
```
